# Pin CI tools image tag used by containerized jobs.
# Examples:
#   CI_IMAGE_TAG=2025.10.10-abcdef12
#   CI_IMAGE_TAG=sha256:deadbeef...   # when using digest form (see notes below)
#   CI_IMAGE_TAG=2025.01.01-00000000            # for local development images
CI_IMAGE_TAG=2025.01.01-00000000
 
# Note: act runs use job-level containers resolved from CI_IMAGE_TAG.
# Make sure your local Docker has the corresponding RuleHub CI image built with this tag, e.g.:
#   ghcr.io/<OWNER>/ci-frontend:${CI_IMAGE_TAG}
# Otherwise act may try to pull from the registry. Rebuilding locally per act run keeps the flow offline and deterministic.
