# Configuration (minimal)

For a quick start, set just the index URL; defaults already point to the official hosted index:

```yaml
rulehub:
  indexUrl: https://rulehub.github.io/rulehub-charts/plugin-index/index.json
```

For deep-link bases, per‑ID mappings, engine‑specific links, and runtime overrides, see the canonical section:

- `DETAILED_GUIDE.md#configuration-app-config` (full details)
- `BACKSTAGE_CONFIG_EXAMPLE.yaml` (example snippet)
